=>I visted the food pand app where I all the avalable cities are stateless, and we can select a city, after that we can select the food type and then resturent which is 
  alse a stateless.
=> Adding to cart is also stateless as we can add items to the cart without login 
=> After that to enter payment method it is necessary to login or signup to the page so this is authentication 
=> We can not add new item to a resturent menu this is authorization 
=> We can not delete any item of a resturent this is authorization
=> we can not give rating to any resturnt with out login this is authentication
